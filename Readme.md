To deploy a Solidity smart contract on Remix - Ethereum IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access Remix IDE:** First, go to the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New Solidity File:** If you already have a Solidity file, you can skip this step. Otherwise, click on the "File Explorer" icon (folder icon at the top-left corner) and create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon.

3. **Paste Solidity Code into File:** Open the Solidity file you created or already have, and paste the Solidity code into it. If you created a new file, make sure to save it before pasting the code.

4. **Check Solidity Code:** Ensure that the Solidity code does not have any syntax errors by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab (flag icon at the top-right corner), then select "Compile".

5. **Deploy the Contract:** Once the Solidity code has been compiled without errors, navigate to the "Deploy & run transactions" tab (ship icon at the top-right corner). In the "Deploy & run transactions" section, you will see a list of compiled smart contracts. Select the contract you want to deploy from this list.

6. **Choose Network:** Choose the network where you want to deploy the contract. You can choose "JavaScript VM" to deploy on a virtual machine network within Remix, or select one of the testnets or mainnet to deploy on the actual blockchain.

7. **Deploy:** Click on the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract. Remix will create a deployment transaction and display details of this transaction.

8. **Confirm Transaction:** If you are deploying on a real blockchain network, you will need to confirm the transaction on your wallet's confirmation window or through another transaction portal like MetaMask.

9. **Wait for Deployment:** After the transaction is confirmed, you will see a confirmation message indicating successful deployment of the smart contract.

10. **Use the Contract:** You have now successfully deployed the contract and can use it on the chosen blockchain network.

Remember that to deploy on real networks, you need to have enough ETH to cover the gas fee for the deployment transaction.
